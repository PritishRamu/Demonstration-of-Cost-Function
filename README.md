It gives us the best fit line for a set of datapoints using  Gradient Descent

Using Gradient Descent we make use of 'Variable Length of Step' instead of 'Fixed Length of Step' in order to get closest to the local minima , through which we can
evaluate exact value of 'm' and 'c'

Hence using the values of these 'm' and 'c' we can create a line which has least 'Minimum Squared Error' w.r.t to our datapoints and fits them almost perfectly.
